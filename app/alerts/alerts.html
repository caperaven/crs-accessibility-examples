        <h2>How to define dialogs</h2>
        <p>
            An <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#alert" target="_blank">alert</a> is an element that displays a brief, important
            message in a way that attracts the user's attention without interrupting  the user's task. Dynamically rendered alerts are automatically
            announced by most screen readers. NOTE: it is important that screen readers do no inform the user of alerts that are present on the page before
            page load completes.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is crucial that alerts do not affect keyboard focus in order to maintain the user's ability to continue working. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#alertdialog" target="_blank">alert dialog</a>
            designed for situations where interrupting work flow is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Avoid designing alerts that disappear automatically. An alert that disappears too quickly can lead to failure to meet
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-no-exceptions.html" target="_blank">WCAG 2.0 success criterion 2.2.3</a>.
            Another critical design consideration is the frequency of interruption caused by alerts. Frequent interruptions inhibit
            usability for people with visual and cognitive disabilities, which makes meeting the requirements of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/time-limits-postponed.html" target="_blank">WCAG 2.0 success criterion 2.2.4</a> more difficult

            Looking at the example above:
            <ul>
                <li>The button triggers the corresponding alert.</li>
                <li>The alert message is wrapped by a parent container with a number of aria related attributes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            It has a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#alert" target="_blank">role of alert</a>, which describes a type of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#dfn-live-region" target="_blank">live region</a> with important,
                            usually time-sensitive, information.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-live" target="_blank">aria-live property</a> indicates that an element will be updated, and describes the types of updates the user agents, assistive technologies, and user can expect from the live.
                            When regions are specified as assertive, assistive technologies will immediately notify the user, and could potentially clear the speech queue of previous updates.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-atomic" target="_blank">aria-atomic property</a> indicates whether assistive technologies will present all, or only parts of, the changed region.
                            If aria-atomic is set to false, assistive technologies will stop searching up the ancestor chain and present only the changed node to the user.
                            IF aria-atomic is set to true, assistive technologies will present the entire contents of the element, including the author-defined live region if one exists.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
