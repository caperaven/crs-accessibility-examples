        <h2>How to define toolbars</h2>
        <p>
            Toolbars act as containers for grouping a set of controls, usually buttons.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#toolbar" target="_blank">toolbar</a> role can be used to communicate the presence and purpose of the grouped elements to screen reader users.
            Grouping controls into toolbars is an effective way of reducing the number of tab stops on keyboard. Below is a simple mark-up example of an accessible toolbar implementation.
        </p>
        <html-to-text src="/templates/toolbar.html"></html-to-text>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/toolbar/toolbar.html"  target="_blank">Toolbar Example</a> implements a toolbar using a roving tabindex to manage focus,
            and contains several types of controls.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following points should be considered to optimize the use of toolbars:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Implement focus management. One tab stop for the toolbar, and arrow keys move focus among toolbar controls.
                <ul>
                    <li>In horizontal toolbars, left and right arrow-keys navigate among controls. Up and down arrow-keys can duplicate
                    left and right arrow-keys respectively, or be reserved to operate controls.</li>
                    <li>In vertical toolbars, up and down arrow-keys navigate among controls, while left and right arrow-keys can duplicate
                    the navigation, or be reserved to operate controls.</li>
                    <li>In toolbars with multiple rows of controls, left and right arrow-keys can provide navigation that wraps from row
                    to row, reserving vertical keys for operation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Avoid including controls whose operation requires the pair of arrow keys used for toolbar navigation
                i.e. don't place a horizontal control within a horizontal toolbar.</li>
            <li>Use toolbar as a grouping element only if the group contains 3 or more controls.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Keyboard Interaction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Tab and Shift+Tab move focus into and out of the toolbar. When focus moves into a toolbar:
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus is set on the first control that is not disabled when moving focus into the toolbar initially.</li>
                    <li>If the toolbar had previously contained focus, focus is either set on the last control that had focus
                    or on the first non-disabled control</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                For horizontal toolbars:
                <ul>
                    <li>Left arrow key moves focus to previous control. Optional: wrap focus from first to last</li>
                    <li>Right arrow key moves focus to next control. Option: wrap focus from last to first</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Home key(optional), moves focus to first element</li>
            <li>End key(optional), moves focus to last element</li>
            <li>For guidance regarding focusability of disabled controls, please refer to WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1 -

        <h2>WAI-ARIA Roles, States & Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The element serving as the toolbar has role <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#toolbar" target="_blank">toolbar</a>.</li>
            <li>If the toolbar has a visible label, it's reference by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-labelledby" target="_blank">aria-labelledby</a>.
            Else the toolbar element has a label provided by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-label" target="_blank">aria-label</a>.</li>
            <li>If vertical toolbar, toolbar element has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-orientation" target="_blank">aria-orientation</a> set to vertical.
            Default orientation is horizontal.</li>
        </ul>
