        <h2>How to define Window Splitters</h2>
        <p>
            A window splitter is a movable separator between two sections, or panes, of a window enabling
            users to change the relative size of the panes. A window splitter can be either variable or fixed.
            A fixed splitter toggles between two positions, whereas a variable splitter can be adjusted to any position
            within an allowed range.
        </p>
        <p>
            A window splitter has a value that represents the size of one of the panes, which in this pattern, is called the primary pane.
            When the splitter has its minimum value, the primary pane has its smallest size and the secondary pane has its largest size.
            The splitter also has an accessible name that matches the name of the primary pane.
            Note: the term "primary pane" does not describe the importance or purpose of content inside the pane.

        <p>
            Looking at the above example:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Two article elements are provided which contain some content, note the div acting as the window-splitter is positioned in between the two article elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Focusing on the div acting as the separator:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            It has the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#separator" target="_blank">separator role</a> indicating a divider separating and distinguishing sections of content (or groups of menu items)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-controls" target="_blank">aria-controls</a> attribute is to "main-content" which is the id reference of the first article. This aria property identifies the element whose content
                            or presence is controlled by the current element
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As no labelling element that would describe the window-splitter is given, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-label" target="_blank">aria-label</a> attribute as been supplied.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-valuenow" target="_blank">aria-valuenow</a> property represents the current position of the separator and is updated as the user interacts with the separator
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-valuemin" target="_blank">aria-valuemin</a> property which defines the minimum allowed value.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-valuemax" target="_blank">aria-valuemax</a> property which defines the maximum value for the range.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finally the tabindex is set to 0 to include the separator in the tab page order.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Keyboard Interaction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Left Arrow: moves a vertical splitter to the left.
            </li>
            <li>
                Right Arrow: moves a vertical splitter to the right.
            </li>
            <li>
                Up Arrow: moves a horizontal splitter up.
            </li>
            <li>
                Down Arrow: moves a horizontal splitter down.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enter: If the primary pane is not collapsed, collapses the pane. If the pane is collapsed, restores the splitter
                to its previous position.
            </li>
            <li>
                Home (Optional): Moves splitter to the position that gives the primary pane its smallest allowed size. This may
                completely collapse the primary pane.
            </li>
            <li>
                End (Optional): Moves splitter to the position that gives the primary pane its largest allowed size. This may
                completely collapse the secondary pane.
            </li>
            <li>
                F6 (Optional): Cycle through window panes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            NOTE: A fixed size splitter omits implementation of the arrow keys

            </li>
            <li>
                If the primary pane has a visible label, it is referenced by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-labelledby" target="_blank">aria-labelledby</a> on the separator element.
                Otherwise, the separator element has a label provided by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-label" target="_blank">aria-label</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                The separator element has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-controls" target="_blank">aria-controls</a> referring to the primary pane.
