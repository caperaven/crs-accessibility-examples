        <h2>How to define Listboxes</h2>
        <p>
            A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#listbox" target="_blank">listbox</a> widget represents a list of options and allows the user to select one (single-select listbox)
            or more (mulit-select listbox) options.
        </p>
        <p>
            When screen readers present a listbox, they may render the name, state and position of each item. The name of
            an option is a string calculated by the browser, typically from the contents of the option element.
            The name does not contain any semantic info, thus if an option contains a semantic element i.e. heading,
            screen reader users will not have access to the semantics. Because of these traits, the listbox widget does
            not provide an accessible way to present a list of interactive elements such as links, buttons or checkboxes.
            To present a list of interactive elements, see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#grid" target="_blank">grid pattern</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Avoid using very long option names to ensure understandability and perceivability for screen reader users.
            The entire name is spoken as single unit of speech when the option is read. When too much ino is spoken as a
            result of a single key press, it is difficult to understand. Sets of options where each option name starts with the same word or phrase can also significantly degrade usability
            for keyboard and screen reader users.
        </p>
        <p>Basic single-select listbox example:</p>
        <html-to-text src="/templates/listbox-example.html"></html-to-text>
        <p>
            Looking at the above exmaple:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The containing unorder list component has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#listbox" target="_blank">role="listbox"</a> indicating a widget
                    that allows the user to select one (or more items) from a list of choices. In this case we are looking at a single-select listbox.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ul element is labelled using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-label" target="_blank">aria-label</a> attribute.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-activedescendant" target="_blank">aria-activedescendant</a> property identifies the currently active element when DOM focus is on a parent element. It provides
                    an alternative method of managing focus for interactive elements that may contain multiple focusable descendants. Instead of moving DOM focus among
                    descendant elements, authors may set DOM focus on elements that support aria-activedescendant and then use the property to refer to the
                    element that is active. In this case, DOM focus stays on the ul element and the property points to the id which is the first li element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The child li elements all have <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#option" target="_blank">role="option"</a> indicating a selectable item in a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#select" target="_blank">select</a> list
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first list item has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-selected" target="_blank">aria-selected</a> set to true, indicating the current "selected" state of the item.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first list item also has a class attribute set to "focused" which will control the styling of the currently selected element, and will update when a new item is selected.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Keyboard Interaction</h2>
        <p>For a vertically oriented listbox:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When a single-select listbox receives focus:
                <ul>
                    <li>If none of the options are selected before the listbox receives focus, the first option receives focus. Optionally the first option may be automatically selected</li>
                    <li>If an option is slected before the lstibox receives focus, focus is set on the selected option</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                When a multi-select listbox receives focus:
                <ul>
                    <li>If none of the options are selected before the list receives focus, focus is set on the first option and the is no automatic change in selection state.</li>
                    <li>If one or more options are selected before the listbox receives focus, focus is set on the first option in the list that is selected.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Down Arrow: Moves focus to the next option. Optionally, in a single-select listbox, selection may also move with focus.
            </li>
            <li>
                Up Arrow: Moves focus to the previous option. Optionally, in a single-select listbox, selection may also move with focus.
            </li>
            <li>
                Home (optional): Moves focus to the next option. Optionally, in a single-selected listbox, selection may also move with focus.
                Supporting this key is strongly recommended for lists with more than five options
            </li>
            <li>
                End (optional): Moves focus to last option. Optionally, in a single-select listbox, selection may also move with focus.
                Supporting this key is strongly recommended for lists with more than five options
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://doc.dynamicweb.com/documentation-9/how-tos/general/implementing-typeahead-search" target="_blank">Type-ahead</a> is recommended for al listboxes, especially those with more than seven options:
                <ul>
                    <li>Type a character: focus moves to the next item with a name that starts with the typed character</li>
                    <li>Type multiple characters in rapid succession: focus moves tot the next item with a name that starts with the string of characters types</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Multiple Selection:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There are two interaction models to support multiple selection:
                        <ul>
                            <li>(Recommended) A model that does not require the user to hold a modifier key, i.e. shift or control, while navigating the list</li>
                            <li>A model that does require modifier keys to be help while navigating in order to avoid losing selection states</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Recommended Selection Model - holding modifier keys is not necessary:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Space: changes the selection state of the focused option</li>
                            <li>Shift + Down Arrow (optional): Moves focus to and toggles the selected state of the next option</li>
                            <li>Shift + Up Arrow (optional): Moves focus to and toggles the selected state of the previous option</li>
                            <li>Shift + Space (optional): Selects the contiguous items from the most recently selected item to the focused item</li>
                            <li>Control + Shift + Home (optional): Selects the focused option and all options up to the first option. Optionally moves focus to the first option</li>
                            <li>Control + Shift + End (optional): Selects the focused option and all options down to the last option. Optionally moves focus to the last option</li>
                            <li>Control + A (optional): Selects all options in the list. Optionally, if all options are selected, it may also unselect all options</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alternative selection model - moving focus without holding a Shift or Control modifier un-selects all selected nodes except the focused node:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Shift + Down Arrow: Moves focus to and toggles the selection state of the next option</li>
                            <li>Shift + Up Arrow:  Moves focus to and toggles the selection state of the previous option</li>
                            <li>Control + down Arrow: Moves focus to the next option without changing its selection state.</li>
                            <li>Control + up Arrow: Moves focus to the previous option without changing its selection state.</li>
                            <li>Control + Space: Changes the selection state of the focused option.</li>
                            <li>Shift + Space (optional): Selects contiguous items from the most recently selected item to the focused item</li>
                            <li>Control + Shift + Home (Optional): Selects the focused option and all options up to the first option. Optionally, moves focus to the first option</li>
                            <li>Control + Shift + End (optional): Selects the focused option and all option down to the last option. Optionally, moves focus to the last option</li>
                            <li>Control + A (Optional): Selects all options in the list. Optionally, if all options are selected, it may also unselect all options.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

        <h2>WAI-ARIA Roles, States & Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                An element that contains or owns all the listbox options has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#listbox" target="_blank">role listbox</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Each option in the listbox has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#option" target="_blank">role option</a> and is a DOM descendant of the element with role listbox or is referenced by
                an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-owns" target="_blank">aria-owns property</a> on the listbox
            </li>
            <li>
                If the listbox is not part of another widget, then it has a visible label referenced by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-labelledby" target="_blank">aria-labelledby</a> on the element
                with role listbox.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a single-select listbox, the selected option has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-selected" target="_blank">aria-selected</a> set to true
            </li>
            <li>
                If the listbox supports multi-select:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The element with role listbox has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-multiselectable" target="_blank">aria-multiselectable</a> set to true
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ALl selected options have <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-selected" target="_blank">aria-selected</a> set to true
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All options that are not selected have <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-selected" target="_blank">aria-selected</a> set to false
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                If the complete set of available options is not present in the DOM due to dynamic loading as the user scrolls,
                their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-setsize" target="_blank">aria-setsize</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-posinset" target="_blank">aria-posinset</a> attributes are set appropriately
            </li>
            <li>
                If options are arranged horizontally, the element with role listbox has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-orientation" target="_blank">aria-orientation</a> set to horizontal.
                The default value of aria-orientation for listbox is vertical.
