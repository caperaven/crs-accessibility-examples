        <h2>How to define buttons</h2>
        <p>
            Buttons enable users to trigger actions/events. In addition to ordinary buttons, WAI-ARIA supports 2 other types:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Toggle Button: A two-state button.To tell assistive tech that a button is a toggle button,
                set <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-pressed" target="_blank">aria-pressed</a> attribute.
                Note: it is important to not change the label when the toggle state changes. If the design calls for the
                label to change with the state, then the aria-pressed attribute is not needed.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#menubutton" target="_blank">Menu Button</a>: Use the
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-haspopup" target="_blank">aria-haspopup</a>
                attribute set to either menu or true to tell assistive technologies that it's dealing with a menu button.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Below is an example of a div that wraps an svg which should act as a button when activated:
        </p>
        <html-to-text src="/templates/svg-buttons.html"></html-to-text>
        <p>
            Here is another example of a similar type of button which acts as a toggle button with the aria-pressed attribute set to "true":
        </p>
        <html-to-text src="/templates/svg-checkox-button.html"></html-to-text>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/button/button.html" target="_blank">button examples</a>
            demonstrate the button design pattern.

        <h2>Keyboard Interaction</h2>
        <p>
            When the button has focus:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Space: Activates the button</li>
            <li>Enter: Activates the button</li>
            <li>
                Following button activation, focus is set depending on the type of action the button performs:
                <ul>
                    <li>If activating the button opens a dialog, focus moves into the dialog</li>
                    <li>If activating the button closing the dialog, focus returns to te button that opened the dialog
                    unless the function performed in the dialog leads to a different element</li>
                    <li>If activating the button does not dismiss the current context, the focus usually remains on the
                        button after activation</li>
                    <li>If the button action changes context, then focus is usually moved to the starting point for the action</li>
                    <li>If the button is activated using shortcut keys, focus usually stays within the context from which
                    the shortcut key was activated.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
