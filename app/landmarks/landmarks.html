        <h2>What are Landmarks</h2>
        <p>
            Using appropriate landmarks help assistive technology understand the overall structure of a web page.
            Using proper HTML elements like headers, navs, and asides are useful to screen readers. They can collect
            the landmarks and tell the user what's available on the page. It helps for navigation purposes as the user
            can jump straight to directly to a footer element, rather that having to navigate to it via tabbing.

        <h2>Article</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" target="_blank">article</a> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site,
            which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable. A given document can have multiple articles in it, with one or more sections within each article.
            They are independent in the sense that they could stand alone. However the element is still associated with its ancestors.
        </p>
        <p>
            They implicitly have the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" target="_blank">article role</a>. NOTE: an article is not a navigational landmark,
            but may be nested to form a discussion where assistive technologies could pay attention to article nesting to assist the user in following the discussion.
        </p>

            Please refer to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" target="_blank">MDN's article definition</a> for a further breakdown of the element.

        <h2>Aside</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside" target="_blank">aside element</a> represents content is only indirectly related to the document's main content.
            They are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.
        </p>
        <p>
            They implicitly have the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#complementary" target="_blank">complementary ARIA role</a> applied, which indicates that contained content is relevant to the main content.
        </p>

        <h2>Footer</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer" target="_blank">footer</a> element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.
        </p>
        <p>
            They implicitly have the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#contentinfo" target="_blank">contentinfo ARIA role</a> when in the context of the body element.
            The contentinfo role specifies a large perceivable region that contains information about the parent document.
            NOTE: The footer element is not a contentinfo landmark when it is a descendant of the following HTML sectioning elements:
            <ul>
                <li>Article</li>
                <li>Aside</li>
                <li>Main</li>
                <li>Nav</li>
                <li>section</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            NOTE: W3 recommends only assigning one element with the contentinfo role within any document or application.
            However, because document and application element can be nested in the DOM, they may have multiple contentinfo elements as DOM descendants.
            This is assuming each of those are associated with different document nodes, either by a DOM nesting, or by use of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-owns" target="_blank">aria-owns attribute</a>
