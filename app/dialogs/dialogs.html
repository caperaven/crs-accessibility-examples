        <h2>How to define dialogs</h2>
        <p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dialog" target="_blank">dialog</a> is a descendant window overlaid
        on either the primary window or another dialog window. You get two types of dialogs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modal Dialogs: Forces the user to complete/cancel the action before going back to their current workflow. They typically cover a large
            portion of the screen, and won't let the user interact with content behind the modal dialog.</li>
            <li>Non-Modal Dialogs: These will still appear on top of the main content, and allow the user to continue to interact with the main content
            without having to complete/cancel the dialog action.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can refer to this <a href="https://uxplanet.org/modality-the-one-ux-concept-you-need-to-understand-when-designing-intuitive-user-interfaces-e5e941c7acb1" target="_blank">article</a>
            on the difference between modal and non-modal dialogs, and when to use them.</p>
        <p>Both modal and non-modal dialogs contain their tab sequence, i.e. tab and shit + tab does not move focus outside the dialog. Modal dialogs do not
        provide means for moving keyboard focus outside the dialog window without closing the dialog.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#alertdialog" target="_blank">alertdialog</a> role is used for dialogs that divert the users' attention
            to a brief important message. Refer to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#alertdialog" target="_blank">alert and message dialog</a> pattern for more on this.</p>
