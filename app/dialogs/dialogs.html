        <h2>How to define dialogs</h2>
        <p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dialog" target="_blank">dialog</a> is a descendant window overlaid
        on either the primary window or another dialog window. You get two types of dialogs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modal Dialogs: Forces the user to complete/cancel the action before going back to their current workflow. They typically cover a large
            portion of the screen, and won't let the user interact with content behind the modal dialog.</li>
            <li>Non-Modal Dialogs: These will still appear on top of the main content, and allow the user to continue to interact with the main content
            without having to complete/cancel the dialog action.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can refer to this <a href="https://uxplanet.org/modality-the-one-ux-concept-you-need-to-understand-when-designing-intuitive-user-interfaces-e5e941c7acb1" target="_blank">article</a>
            on the difference between modal and non-modal dialogs, and when to use them.</p>
        <p>Both modal and non-modal dialogs contain their tab sequence, i.e. tab and shit + tab does not move focus outside the dialog. Modal dialogs do not
        provide means for moving keyboard focus outside the dialog window without closing the dialog.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#alertdialog" target="_blank">alertdialog</a> role is used for dialogs that divert the users' attention
            to a brief important message. Refer to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#alertdialog" target="_blank">alert and message dialog</a> pattern for more on this.</p>
        <p>Included below are a couple of examples of basic modal dialogs:</p>
        <html-to-text src="/templates/modal-dialog-example.html"></html-to-text>
        <p>Note: in the above example role="dialog" is defined on the parent element, and aria-labelledby="dialog1-label" references the h2 element's ID attribute.
        The h2 element's inner text (in this case "Dialog Header") will be read out by the screen reader when the user initially enters the dialog. The aria-modal attribute
        has also been set to true to show this is a modal dialog.</p>
        <html-to-text src="/templates/modal-dialog-example2.html"></html-to-text>
        <p>In the second example, note the inclusion of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-describedby" target="_blank">aria-describedby</a>="dialog2-desc". This aria property
        is similar to aria-labelledby as they both reference other elements to calculate a text alternative, but where a label needs to be concise, a description is intented to provide
        more verbose information.</p>
        <p>A note on dialog labeling: let's say the initial example's dialog contained a button that opened the second example's dialog as another modal dialog. It is important
        that each dialog's aria-labelledby is referenced by a unique element id. If the second dialog's aria-labelledby property was set to "dialog1-label" the screen reader
        would read the initial dialog's header, even if it was hidden.</p>

        <h2>Keyboard Interaction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When a dialog opens, focus usually moves to the first element inside the dialog.
                <ul>
                    <li>Focus placement depends on the nature and size of the content.</li>
                    <li>
                        If content is large enough that focusing the first interactive element could cause the beginning
                        of the content to scroll out of view, it is advisable to add tabindex="-1" to a static element at
                        top of the dialog, i.e. dialog title or first paragraph.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a dialog is the last step in a process that is not easily reversible, such as deleting data
                        or completing a financial transaction, it may be advisable to set focus on the least destructive
                        action, especially if undoing the action is difficult or impossible.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a dialog is limited to interactions that either provide additional information or continue processing,
                        it may be advisable to set focus to the element that is likely to be most frequently used, such as an "OK"
                        or "Continue" button.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Tab:
                <ul>
                    <li>Moves focus to the next tabbable element inside the dialog.</li>
                    <li>If focus is on the last tabbable element, moves focus to the first tabbable element inside the dialog</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Shift + Tab:
                <ul>
                    <li>Moves focus to the previous tabbable element inside the dialog</li>
                    <li>If focus is on the first tabbable element, moves focus to the last tabbable element inside the dialog</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Escape: closes the dialog.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>WAI-ARIA Roles, States & Properties</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The element that serves as the dialog container has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dialog" target="_blank">role="dialog"</a></li>
            <li>All elements required to operate the dialog are descendants of the element that has role dialog</li>
            <li>The dialog container element has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-modal" target="_blank">aria-modal</a>="true"</li>
            <li>
                The dialog has either:
                <ul>
                    <li>A value set for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-labelledby" target="_blank">aria-labelledby</a> property that refers to a visible dialog title</li>
                    <li>A label specified by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-label" target="_blank">aria-label</a></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Optionally, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-describedby" target="_blank">aria-describedby</a> property is set on the element with the dialog role
                to indicate which element(s) in the dialog contain content that describes the primary purpose or message of the dialog.
                Specifying descriptive elements enables screen readers to announce the description along with the dialog title and initially focused
                element when the dialog opens.
            </li>
        </ul>
